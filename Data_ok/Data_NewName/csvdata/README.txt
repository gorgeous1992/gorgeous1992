1. The 072216 means July 22, 2016.
2. The data are from that day.
3. wavenum is the wavenumber data, wavefreq is wave frequency, Depth is the H.

For wavenumbers and wavefrequences

It has 4 coordinates: {wavetype, x, y, wavenum(freq)}

4. x coordinate range [80:10:800]
5. y coordinate range [-500:25:1500]

For Depth data,
6. x, y coordinates are on 4th and 5th columns, x [50:12:950], y [-100: 24: 1100]
   H is the 3rd column. All we need are 3, 4, 5th columns.
